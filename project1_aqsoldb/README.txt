# Project 1 – AqSolDB Aqueous Solubility

This folder contains the notebook for Project 1 in my `molecular-ml-projects` repo.

**Goal.** Predict aqueous solubility (logS) in water for ~10k organic and inorganic compounds from the AqSolDB dataset using classical ML models on RDKit descriptors.

**Notebook.** See `project1-aqsoldb-solubility.ipynb` in this folder for full code, plots, and scientific error analysis.

For a nicely rendered version, see the Kaggle notebook linked in the main repository README.
